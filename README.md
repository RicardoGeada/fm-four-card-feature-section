## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- SCSS

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of responsive design using CSS Grid. I learned how to structure grid layouts effectively across different screen sizes and gained confidence in using grid-template-areas for more complex arrangements.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing CSS Grid and Flexbox in future projects to improve my ability to build clean, flexible, and responsive layouts. I'll also explore combining both techniques more efficiently depending on the design requirements.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to work with css grid.
